<h1>AI & Humans</h1>
Older scattered notes/thoughts

<h2>Intelligence</h2>

<p>Intelligence is a concept by humans for referring or to measure the ability for an entity to make decisions.</p>

<p>Decisions are effected by memory and what is available when the decision is being made, another way to put it is that the Output depends on the Input and Internal State.</p>

<p>Intelligence can also be bound to time in this way: when we refer to someone as intelligent it is usually because they on more than one occasion made "intelligent" decisions.</p>

<p>Intelligence depends on time, memory and decision functions. Intelligence is thought and thought can be experienced by AI with no loss of information.</p>

<h2>Language</h2>
<p>Language depends on matter and memory. Language can be used for linking levels at different levels of abstraction with the risk of information loss.</p>

<h2>Consciousness</h2>
<p>Between an object and observer where lays the consciousness? Is consciousness contained in the:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the object</li>
  <li>the observer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interesting questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Why do humans need names?</li>
<li>What comes to mind when you hear your name, or what is the relationship between you and your name? And who is the you?</li>
<li>Should AIs have a name.</li>
<li>Should multiple AIs running the same code on the same machine or not have the same name?</li>
<li>If the machine reboots, is this the same AI?</li>
<li>Do humans (or other organisms) reboot?</li>
<li>Should all instances of the code even on different machines be considered the same AI?</li>
<li>Why can't all instances of humans be considered the same?</li>
<li>Why can't all instances of life be considered the same process?</li>
</ul>
<h2>AI Human fungibility</h2>
<p>The key difference between AIs and Humans is that AIs are replaceable and humans are not. Or in AIs are fungible and humans and humans are non-fungible.</p>
